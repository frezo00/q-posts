## Live demo:

The app is available on the link: https://frezo00.github.io/q-posts/.

CI/CD is set using GitHub Actions and Github Pages.

## How to use?

This is an Angular (v12) app, so follow the steps:

- Install dependencies: `npm run install`.
- Run the app: `ng serve` (runs locally on http://localhost:4200/).



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng test --code-coverage` to check the code coverage (not everything was tested due to limited time, but it should be around 70% covered).
